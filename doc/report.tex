\begin{abstract}
\par Player position in ice hockey is very important for defense and attack. Unlike in other team games in 
ice hockey players usually play in two lines attack with three players and defense with two. Recently, the NHL has 
published new data about each game. As new statistical analysis tools such as scalable vector
machines become available, it becomes possible to analyze player positions more holistically by using a wide
range of statistical methods. The aims of this study were to predict players positions by looking at 
the statistics of an individual player.

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Sophisticated model would help NHL teams to figure out which players they should acquire and sell to keep necessary backup for line positions,
			\item NHL teams could use this model to figure out which players should play on which position to unleash their true potential based on statistics,
			\item According to Variance Treshold all of the columns are important for position classification,
			\item Defence position classification is almost certainly true,
		\end{itemize}
